                        Wooof Foundation believe in dog. We fund and support dog rescue and adoption projects all over the world to help further our mission to reduce the world’s 600 million stray dog population.
                        <br/>
                       className="sImg"  We aim to put an end to the suffering that all too many dogs face on a daily basis. We achieve this by tackling four key areas to ensure that we get to the root of the growing problem:

                        <p className="text">
                        We fund, manage and support a wide number of national rescue and adoption initiatives, helping to rescue dogs and allowing them to experience the love, safety and kindness they so desperately deserve.

                        Sterilisation

                        <p className="text">We organise and fund spay and neuter programmes, including research into new sterilisation techniques. Mass sterilisation remains the only compassionate means of effectively combatting the rapidly growing number of dogs born into a life of suffering and misery.</p>

                        <p className="text">Delivering education initiatives, with a particular focus on children, we help to teach the next generation how important it is to care for animals. These campaigns serve to lay the foundations for a future fuelled by compassion and respect.</p>

                        <p className="text">We create, promote and support campaigns that raise awareness of animal suffering. Through our international projects, we engage communities with the importance of neutering animals, and instil the benefits of adoption over buying pets.</p>

                        <p className="text"><strong>Wild at Heart Foundation’s mission is to compassionately reduce the global stray dog population through rescue and rehoming, sterilisation campaigns, and international education projects.</strong></p>
                        <br/>
                        <p className="text">There are over 600 million stray dogs in the world. In addition, it is estimated that around 1 billion unwanted puppies are born on the streets each year. Most of these die a bleak and painful death before they reach three years old. The “lucky” ones that beat these odds are, in the main, subjected to a life of struggle, battling against disease, starvation, mistreatment and violent abuse as they fight to survive.</p>
                        <img  className="bImg" src="https://wildatheartfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sterilising-street-dogs-to-prevent-overbreeding-e1574166376522.jpeg" alt=""/>
                        <p className="text">We believe that every single dog – no matter where in the world it is born, no matter its size, breed, age or circumstance – deserves to live a healthy, happy life. With your help, we can give street dogs around the world this chance, and help fight back against the rising tide of cruelty, abuse and neglect.</p>
                        <h2 className="h22">Our Beliefs</h2>
                        <p className="text">Wooof Foundation believe in dog. We believe that a dog can lift our mood, change our day, keep us active and transform a house into a home. They are our fierce protectors, guard us and perform heroic feats. They offer freely what humans can spend a lifetime learning, which is to love unconditionally. They save our lives in many ways.</p>

                        <p className="text">This is why Wild at Heart Foundation wants to end the suffering of these amazing creatures. Through our international dog rescue and adoption work, we are working towards a day when every dog, no matter where in the world they come from, can live a life free from fear and pain.</p>
